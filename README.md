# eup-sort
Intended to sort through a giant list of .ytd's and .ydd's from EUP clothing pack for FiveM so you do not need to replace.

set EUPDirectory to the full directory where you have the EUP download in one single folder.
Others are self explantory

It will **copy** files and rename them inside of EUPDirectory.  

It may or may not work completely, good luck.

I'm still working on it
